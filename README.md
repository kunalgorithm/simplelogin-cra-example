# SimpleLogin Create React App Example

# SimpleLogin NextJS example

To get started, sign up at [SimpleLogin](https://simplelog.in/) and create a new project. Then, copy the generated API key.

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and set `REACT_APP_SIMPLELOGIN_KEY` to the API key for your project.

Create react app will read the value from the environment and associate your app with your newly created project, so you'll be able to see new users as they sign up in the _Users_ tab.
